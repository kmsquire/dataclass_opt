# This repository uses conventional-commits, which have the following form:
#
#
#     feat(scope)!: Implemented a cool new feature
#
#     * We were missing this feature previously, and we sorely needed it
#     * The feature makes our code run 1000x faster
#
#     BREAKING CHANGE: you need to update your code to use this version
#     Co-authored-by: fred-flintstone@secondspectrum.com
#
#
# The prefix must be one of the following:
#
#    build:    Changes affecting the build system or external dependencies
#              (example scopes: poetry, npm, make)
#    ci:       Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
#    docs:     Documentation only changes
#    feat:     A new feature
#    fix:      A bug fix
#    perf:     A code change that improves performance
#    refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#    style:    Changes that do not affect code meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
#    test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#
# The (scope) is optional, but recommended especially for monorepos with
# many subprojects.
#
# The "!" in the subject line and the "BREAKING CHANGE:" in the footer are both
# indicators that this commit is a breaking change, and as such, requires a major
# version bump (unless the version starts with a "0").  At least one of these is
# required for breaking changes.
