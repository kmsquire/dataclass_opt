Our Standards \u00a4 Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: Using welcoming and inclusive language Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences Gracefully accepting constructive criticism Focusing on what is best for the community Showing empathy towards other community members Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Our Responsibilities \u00a4 Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Scope \u00a4 This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. Environment setup \u00a4 Nothing easier! Fork and clone the repository, then: cd dataclass-opt make setup Note If it fails for some reason, you'll need to install Poetry manually. You can install it with: python3 -m pip install --user pipx pipx install poetry Now you can try running make setup again, or simply poetry install . You now have the dependencies installed. You can run the application with poetry run [ARGS...] . Run make help to see all the available actions! Tasks \u00a4 This project uses duty to run tasks. A Makefile is also provided. The Makefile will try to run certain tasks on multiple Python versions. If for some reason you don't want to run the task on multiple Python versions, you can do one of the following: export PYTHON_VERSIONS= : this will run the task with only the current Python version run the task directly with poetry run duty TASK , or duty TASK if the environment was already activated through poetry shell The Makefile detects if the Poetry environment is activated, so make will work the same with the virtualenv activated or not. Development \u00a4 As usual: create a new branch: git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name edit the code and/or the documentation If you updated the documentation or the project dependencies: run make docs-regen run make docs-serve , go to http://localhost:8000 and check that everything looks good Before committing: run make format to auto-format the code run make check to check everything (fix any warning) run make test to run the tests (fix any issue) follow our commit message convention If you are unsure about how to fix or ignore a warning, just let the continuous integration fail, and we will help you during review. Don't bother updating the changelog, we will take care of this. Commit message convention \u00a4 Commits messages must follow the Angular style : <type>[(scope)]: Subject [Body] Scope and body are optional. Type can be: build : About packaging, building wheels, etc. chore : About packaging or repo/files management. ci : About Continuous Integration. docs : About documentation. feat : New feature. fix : Bug fix. perf : About performance. refactor : Changes which are not features nor bug fixes. style : A change in code style/format. tests : About tests. Subject (and body) must be valid Markdown. If you write a body, please add issues references at the end: Body. References: #10, #11. Fixes #15. Pull requests guidelines \u00a4 Link to any related issue in the Pull Request message. During review, we recommend using fixups: # SHA is the SHA of the commit you want to fix git commit --fixup = SHA Once all the changes are approved, you can squash your commits: git rebase -i --autosquash master And force-push: git push -f If this seems all too complicated, you can push or force-push each new commit, and we will squash them ourselves if needed, before merging.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
